# Spectral_Analysis_Package
Tools for spectral analysis in 1D. Includes rotary spectral capabilities.

2D spectral estimation is functional but not yet ready to be uploaded.

Versions compatible with GNU/Octave (slight chages from default MATLAB versions) should be available in the future. Feel free to branch your own GNU/Octave version if I do not get around to this in a timely manner.
