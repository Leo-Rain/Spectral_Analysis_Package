# Spectral_Analysis_Package
Tools for spectral analysis in 1D. Includes rotary spectral capabilities.

Improvements are needed for the 2D spectral estimation to become as flexible as the 1D spectral estimation functions available in this repository.

Versions compatible with GNU/Octave (slight chages from default MATLAB versions) should be available in the future. Feel free to branch your own GNU/Octave version if I do not get around to this in a timely manner.
